## Overview

This is a scalable and production-ready **Node.js backend template** designed for enterprise and large-scale applications. It follows industry best practices for **security**, **monitoring**, **logging**, **testing**, and **CI/CD** integration, ensuring that your backend is robust, maintainable, and performant.

This template is built using **Express.js** and follows the **CommonJS** module system for simplicity and compatibility.
